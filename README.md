# Real-Estate-Price-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
This is a machine learning project on predicting prices of real estate properties where three different ML algorithms have been used and whichever has the best accuracy is given to the pipeline created to make predictions of the properties, given the regions and areas, in this project, the data of the city Bangalore is taken in consideration.

Here we've compared three algorithms, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression.

In the notebook first we import the data which is in the '.csv' format, then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which includes fillng the null values, in the necessary columns, then calculate the price per square feet in the regions in the dataset.

After that outlier detection and removal is done, and then finally clean the data.

After cleaning the data apply and compare the accuracy scores of the alogrithms.
